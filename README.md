## Task
The problem is to create a fully functional Tetris game that adheres to specific gameplay mechanics and visual requirements. 
The challenge includes implementing various game features such as Tetrimino movement, rotation, collision detection, line clearing, and integrating a scoring system. Additional challenges involve handling different devices for input, ensuring smooth gameplay with a consistent speed curve, and managing sound effects and music.

## Description
The problem has been solved by creating a JavaScript-based Tetris game using HTML5 Canvas for rendering. The solution involves:
Game Initialization: Setting up the canvas and game context, initializing the game state, and defining the Tetrimino shapes and colors.
Rendering: Drawing the game matrix and upcoming pieces on the canvas.
Gameplay Mechanics: Implementing piece movement, rotation, and collision detection. Added functionality for dropping pieces, clearing full rows, and updating the score.
User Input: Handling keyboard events for player controls such as moving, rotating, and dropping pieces.
Game Loop: Managing the game loop to continuously update and render the game state.

## Installation
Ensure you have a modern web browser to run the HTML file.

## Usage
Start the Game:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Controls:
Arrow Left/Right: Move the Tetrimino left/right.
Arrow Down: Drop the Tetrimino faster.
Arrow Up or 'x': Rotate the Tetrimino clockwise.
'z' or 'Control': Rotate the Tetrimino counterclockwise.
'Shift' or 'c': Hold the current Tetrimino.
Space: Hard drop the Tetrimino.
Escape or F1: Pause/Resume the game.
